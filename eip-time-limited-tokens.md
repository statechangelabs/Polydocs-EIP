## Simple Summary

This standard describes a simple, supple interface for expressing and transferring time-limited rights or obligations, also known as leases. 

## Motivation
Time is the ultimate scarce resource. We have less of it every second. Time slicing is critical to ideas of fractional possession - allocating rights for a finite period allows resources to generate more value for more humans without requiring their growth or change.

The surging popularity of ERC721 tokens shows the opportunity for clear, simple standards for allocating property rights on the blockchain. Critical to any idea of property rights is the ability to lend or lease an asset for a limited period of time. Blockchain has a unique opportunity to permit these transactions without trust or a third party guarantor because of the public, immutable record. 

However, ERC721 and related standards do not provide functionality to enable leasing of NFTs or other assets for a specific period. 

Allocating time-based rights in a standard that lets people know who possesses a given asset, as separate from ultimate ownership. The question is who has possession at a specific point in time. For example, the tenant/occupant of a flat can change between months or years, while ownership is indefinite. This standard looks at the question of allocating those rights, who one can allocate them from (e.g. subletting), and looking into the future to understand who will have those rights for making future use case decisions.

## Use Cases

### Electronic Apartment Lock - "Web3-n-B"

People lease apartments from property owners. Sometimes, we want to re-lease access to that apartment to a third party, a la as an AirBnB host. We want to give access to the apartment to the sub-letter for a specific period of time, and the sub-letter should expect that they will have privacy, e.g. the original tenant does not intrude during this period. The tenant has a lease from the property owner that might last a year. The goal is to tell the apartment lock to allow that tenant access during their term, and to transfer that access to the subletter during their (shorter) stay. A blockchain-powered lock could grant access based on who has the rights to that apartment at that point in time. The contract will allow other sublet arrangements to happen, and because it is on the contract, everything is transparent to the original owner, along with the potential for payment to the original owner for the privilege of making these sublet arrangements. 

### Blockchain-powered automobile ignition - "EthCar"

Self-driving cars will be really expensive. Leasing them will probably be important for people to affordably get access. But we don’t need our car all the time. Leasing time windows to people for use of the vehicle will allow people to get access to the car (potentially even telling it to drive to one’s location) for a fixed period of time. All transactions for these rides would run on the chain, and if you get the ride to a location, and you do not need the ride until you are done, you can re-lease time on the vehicle to another lessee in a re-lease transaction. Now there is no wasted “downtime” on the vehicle. The vehicle gates access based on whether the current occupant’s address (e.g. msgSender) is the leaseholder at that point in time. 

### Other potential use cases:

- Renting streaming media
- Library books
- Staking financial assets
- Land deals
- Travel arrangements
- Seats at sports venues

## Rationale
We believe that industry and type-specific interfaces will become common to make dapps easier to build in specific industries - real estate, transportation, finance. 

There is some prior art that if anything reinforces the gap in standards for this basic rights management need.Transferring ownership is the only way to “lend,” and that leads to a requirement for massive collateralization (see renft.io). This defeats the affordability aspect of a lease arrangement: one must basically be able to afford to buy the house outright before being able to lease it! In another example, Cryptopunks uses a “white space” function to implement a bespoke method for leasing their NFTs for a fixed 99-day period. (cryptopunks.rent)

## Backwards Compatibility and Test Cases
This is designed as an ERC with the lease keyword added to all functions in order to prevent name conflicts. 

## Reference Implementation
[Non-Fungible Travel Services](./nftravel) lets you lease airplanes for future travel. The owners of the airplanes approve leases by travellers in certain future dates. The implementation cuts down on potential gas costs by leveraging the idea of rounding all lease units to complete calendar days (based on midnight-midnight UTC-5). 

## Security and Implementation Considerations
### Gas Consumption
Time-limited tokens are more mathematically involved because of the need to compare potentially quite fine distinctions (e.g. to the second or the block) in time windows. Our standard creates the opportunity to reduce that impact through setting a MIN_LEASE_LENGTH and a START_TIME that, when combined, mean the effective number of combinations falls dramatically. E.g. if the MIN_LEASE_LENGTH is 86,400s, and the START_TIME is midnight UTC-7, only whole days are calculated, allowing internal storage to be much simpler. 

### Lessee rights vs owner rights
Property rights often consider ownership to be "absolute," but lessee rights are not. Enumerating and managing what it means to be a lessee without blindly just checking "lesseeOf" will be important to connecting on-chain knowledge to real-world considerations. 

### Transferability
In a specific case of the preceding, it is entirely probable that a property owner will not want a lessee to further subdivide or reassign their rights. This is common in many residential real estate situations. This proposal would allow that kind of control if the contract considers it explicitly.
